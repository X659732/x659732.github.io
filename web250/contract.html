	    <h2>Course Contract</h2>
	   	
		<p>
		I, <a href="introduction.html">Demetrius L. Johnson</a> agree to abide by the terms in my Spring WEB250_N801 Database Driven Websites with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.
		</p>
	
		<p>
		I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. 
		I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
		</p>
	
		<p>
		I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class.
		As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as an absences.
		</p>
